# proposal

Here are my  experiences and proposals for open source activities, such as Google Summer of Code(GSoC) and CAS Open Source Promotion Plan(OSPP), or GLCC, an open source activity that is more academic.

Proof of completion of an open source internship is also here.

## GSoC

The world famous open source event has been held for 18 consecutive years. In 2022, 4k people applied worldwide, 1k people were selected, and about 50 people in China were selected. （It's a resume of a friend of mine, which I think looks really good right here）

## OSPP

About 100 communities, hundreds of projects. I remember that when I participated, there seemed to be 400 people selected. 

More than half of them are graduate students, and the remaining 200 are undergraduate students. 

I am the only one selected in Henan Province.
